<h1><span>What Are Functions in R?</span></h1>

Functions are EVERYWHERE in R and you've most likely have used some already even if you haven't made any yourself:
<br>
--

- Functions in R can be considered *objects* that we can use to **do something.**

--

- According to the book [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html#function-fundamentals) by [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham), Most functions are made up of three parts:
  - `formals()` - arguments that control how the function's called
  - `body()` - the code inside of the function
  - `environment()` - the structure that determines how the function finds the values associated the names in the function

--

- In this presentation, we'll focus mainly on **`formals`** and the **`body`** components of custom functions that can be used in rtistry.

<h1><span>What Are Functions in R?</span></h1>

Let's look at an example of a basic function:

```{r basic_ex, echo=TRUE, eval = TRUE}

# Creating a function named "rtistry_message":
rtistry_message <- function(adjective){
  
  # Setting up our custom message:
  todays_message = paste("Today is a", adjective, "Day for Rtistry!")
  
  # Returning our custom message to the console:
  return(todays_message)
}
```

--
```{r ex_output, echo= TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# Using our function:
rtistry_message("Great")

```

--

The **`adjective`** argument is a `formal()` that will control how the function is called. **Everything** inside of the curly brackets `{ }` is the `body()` of the function. In rtistry, we can create simple or complex functions to assist in the creation of our pieces.

--

- Streamline code
--

- Reduce any manual work that needs to be done
--

- Make it easier to create variations in your work
--

- Build up a tool box of functionalities, especially for things you'd like to do often.

<h1><span>Using Base R</span></h1>

We've already seen a quick example of how we can create functions in R with the `function()` directive. Just like with many processes in R, you can make functions completely using Base R without any extra packages, if you're an R purist.
